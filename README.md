# Hey there! 👋
I'm **Ehab**, a third-year computer science student who loves backend development

And I use projects as my main way to learn and sharpen my skills

If I get an idea, I usually build it — even if it's small — just to explore the concept fully.

---

## Tech & Tools I Use
- C#, .NET, EF Core  
- Windows Forms  
- SQL Server  

---

## Goals
- Become strong in backend architecture  
- Build more real systems with clean, maintainable structure   

---

## Fun Facts
- I enjoy organizing code even more than writing it  
- I remake projects so often that “Clean Code” should pay me rent.
- My brain loves debugging more than starting from scratch 😄
